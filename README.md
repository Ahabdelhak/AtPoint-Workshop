# AtPoint-Workshop
The main problem our application addresses is, connecting drivers whose cars are  broken down on the road and are in an emergency with the nearest service point that can  provide the drivers with the service they need in an efficient and effective manner

The core of our project relies in these two points:  
1. Help drivers locate the nearest point where the car can be served and maintained 
using an Android application. This as mentioned above leads to reduction in car 
accidents, and saved time, money and effort. 
2. The application will have two interfaces: one that helps drivers locate the nearest 
available service point and call for help, and the other through which staff at service 
points will handle and deal with drivers' requests. 
 
 The project has three main outputs, which are: 
1. Drivers Application: 
This is an application that drivers use to: locate and contact service points, book 
appointments, browse and review service points. 

2. Service Points Application: 
Through this application service points can: accept or decline requests, issue bills 
and view the route to the location, from which the request was made, on a map, as well as, 
the time and distance taken to reach it.

3. Website: 
The website is an introductory website where users can: download the app, know 
more about the application, contact us and send their feedback. 
 
 
 
 The drivers interface has three main components: 
1. S.O.S.: here drivers can locate the nearest service point in case of emergency. 
2. Booking: using this feature allows car owners to book and schedule an appointment 
for car maintenance whenever they desire as long as the service point has a capacity 
to serve them at the picked date and time. 
3. Do it yourself: drivers can access a guide through which they can fix their own cars 
themselves, if needed.  

Service point-interface features: 
1. Accepting booking and S.O.S. requests. 
2. Viewing the estimated time and distance to reach the location of an S.O.S. request. 
3. Viewing a map with the best route to take to reach the location of an S.O.S. request. 
4. Scheduling appointments and managing booking process.    
5. Promoting services and products. 
6. Managing mechanics and services.  
7. Receive and record bills. 
 
 
The system uses Firebase which is Google's mobile platform through which 
developing high-quality Android applications is developed. We decided to use it because 
it has a cloud storage, allows hosting, cloud messaging and remote configuration, has a 
Realtime database, ensures authentication, performs crash analysis and monitoring, and 
uses predictions, app indexing and dynamic links.
